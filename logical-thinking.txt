Logical Thinking Behind the Project

1. Input Understanding & Validation

 Given: A Reddit profile URL.

 Goal: Convert it into a usable Reddit username (/user/antony/ → antony).

 Logic: Parse the URL and extract the username correctly.


2. Data Collection Strategy

 What to fetch?

  Posts (submissions) made by the user

  Comments on other posts

 Why?

  These are the only data points i can analyze to understand the user.

 Logic:

  Limit the number (say last 100 posts/comments) to make processing efficient.

  Use PRAW API or web scraping depending on access.


3. Text Analysis: Inferring the Persona

 What can you infer from text?

 | Evidence                        | Logical Inference                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Talks about coding or CS        | Possibly a student or developer      |
| Mentions "my kids love..."      | Likely a parent                      |
| Comments mostly in r/fitness    | Interested in health or bodybuilding |
| "I live in Bangalore"           | Location = Bangalore                 |
| “Struggling with mental health” | Reflective, emotionally expressive   |


 Logic: i need to map text patterns → human traits.

 I can use:

  Keywords

  Topic modeling

  LLMs (to summarize or infer personality)

 Key: Look for context, frequency, and emotion.


4. Persona Building Logic

 A user persona includes:

  Demographics: Age, Gender, Location

  Psychographics: Interests, Beliefs, Personality

  Behavioral: Subreddits visited, language style, etc.


{
  "Age": "Estimated 25-35 (mentions final year student, so likely early adult)",
  "Occupation": "Student (from 'studying computer science')",
  "Personality": "Curious, detailed (based on lengthy and analytical comments)",
  "Location": "India (from 'I live in Mumbai')",
  ...
}

5. Citing Evidence

  Logic: Every persona trait must be backed by one or more Reddit comments/posts.

  This ensures transparency and explainability.

  Occupation: Software Engineer  
  Cited from: "As a backend developer, I use Python and Flask daily."
  Link: reddit.com/r/programming/comments/xxxx

6. Final Output Logic

   Why use a text file?
     
      Easy to review
      Can be automated/scheduled
Format it clearly for readability (sections, indentation, etc.)


Summary: Logical Thinking Breakdown

| Step           | Logic Applied                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Input Parsing  | Extract username from URL                       |
| Data Gathering | API or scrape recent posts/comments             |
| Analysis       | Detect patterns in language, topics, subreddits |
| Inference      | Translate patterns to persona traits            |
| Citation       | Link back each insight to original text         |
| Output         | Organize clearly into a text file               |
